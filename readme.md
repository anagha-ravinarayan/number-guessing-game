# Number Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game implementation in Python. 

The program randomly generates a number between and including 1 and 100. Your objective is to correctly guess the number using a limited number of guesses. It consists of 2 difficulty levels: easy and hard. The easy level has 10 guesses and the hard level has 5 guesses. After each guess you are given feedback whether your guess was too low or too high compared to the number.
